` `
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need Magic Music Visuals. Magic is a powerful and versatile software that lets you create stunning music visualizers, VJ software, live video mixers, music video creators, and much more.
` `
Magic is not just a preset-based visualizer. It gives you an intuitive, modular interface to create your own visuals from scratch, using many colorful and exciting effects. You can draw abstract geometric patterns that dance and spin according to audio volume and frequency, display images and 3D models that move, rotate, and pulse with beats, perform real-time video manipulation with multiple simultaneous movie files and live cameras, render beautiful GLSL shaders and GPU-accelerated graphics synchronized to music, and much more.
` `
Magic works well with all types of live audio, MIDI, and OSC (Open Sound Control) sources, including microphones, turntables, guitars, synthesizers, drum machines, multitrack audio editors, hardware controllers, lighting control systems, and more. You can also import and play back audio and MIDI files so you can design scenes and videos for your favorite artists' tracks or your own unique pre-recorded songs.
` `
Magic compositions can be presented in full-screen mode for live performances, or exported to movie files for further editing or uploading to video sharing sites like YouTube and Vimeo. Magic is used throughout the world in major concert tours, nightclubs, sports stadiums, amusement parks, plays and musicals, casinos, planetariums, museums, event venues, film/video productions, art and music schools, houses of worship, spas and resorts, yoga/fitness classes, and an ever-growing number of home studios.
` `
If you are a musician, composer, DJ, VJ, video editor, graphic designer, animator, or any other kind of multimedia content creator, we urge you to give Magic a try. You can download the free demo version from their official website[^1^] and see for yourself what Magic can do for you. The demo version has almost all the functionality of the full performer edition. The only limitations are that saving is disabled, and a watermark will appear on the output after 30 days.
` `
